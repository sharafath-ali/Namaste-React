## Emmet

Emmet is a web development tool and abbreviation engine that makes writing HTML and CSS code faster and more efficient. It allows developers to write shorthand abbreviations, called Emmet abbreviations, which are then expanded into full HTML or CSS code snippets. This helps speed up the coding process by reducing the amount of typing needed to create complex structures.

### Example

With Emmet, you can type a simple abbreviation like `div>p*3`, and when expanded, it becomes:

```html
<div>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
</div>

Emmet is commonly used in popular text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA and PhpStorm. It's a valuable tool for web developers looking to increase their productivity when writing HTML and CSS code.

CDN (Content Delivery Network)
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of distributed servers located in multiple data centers across various geographical locations. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content (such as web pages, images, videos, scripts, and other media files) to users more efficiently and reliably.

React
React, the JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is known as "React" because of its core concept of reacting to changes in data.

The crossorigin Attribute in <script> Tags
The crossorigin attribute in a <script> tag is like a little instruction for the browser when it's fetching a script from a different website. It tells the browser whether it's okay to share some extra information, like cookies or authentication details, along with the request for that script.

anonymous: This means the browser can fetch the script without sending any extra information.

use-credentials: This means the browser should send some extra information, like cookies or authentication details, along with the request for the script.

If the crossorigin attribute is specified without a value, like this:

html
Copy code
<script crossorigin src="https://example.com/script.js"></script>
then it defaults to the anonymous value. So, it's essentially the same as specifying crossorigin="anonymous". In this case, the browser fetches the script without sending any extra information along with the request.

React vs ReactDOM
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
ReactDOM is a package that provides methods for rendering React components in the DOM (Document Object Model) and managing their lifecycle.
React Development and Production Versions
react.development.js: This file is intended for development purposes. It includes additional development-specific features such as helpful warning messages, debugging tools, and error messages with detailed information. The code is not minified or optimized for size, making it larger and slower to load compared to the production version. It is suitable for development environments where debugging and error handling are prioritized over performance.

react.production.js: This file is intended for production use. It does not include development-specific features like warning messages or debugging tools, resulting in a smaller file size and faster loading times. The code is minified and optimized for size, reducing the file size to improve performance in production environments. It is recommended to use the production version in live production environments to ensure optimal performance and reduced bandwidth usage.
