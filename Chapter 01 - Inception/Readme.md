1. Emmet is a web development tool and abbreviation engine that makes writing HTML and CSS code faster and more efficient. It allows developers to write shorthand abbreviations, called Emmet abbreviations, which are then expanded into full HTML or CSS code snippets. This helps speed up the coding process by reducing the amount of typing needed to create complex structures.

For example, with Emmet, you can type a simple abbreviation like div>p\*3, and when expanded, it becomes:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
</div>

Emmet is commonly used in popular text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA and PhpStorm. It's a valuable tool for web developers looking to increase their productivity when writing HTML and CSS code.

2. CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of distributed servers located in multiple data centers across various geographical locations. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content (such as web pages, images, videos, scripts, and other media files) to users more efficiently and reliably.

3. React, the JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is known as "React" because of its core concept of reacting to changes in data.

4. ## The `crossorigin` Attribute in `<script>` Tags

The `crossorigin` attribute in a `<script>` tag is like a little instruction for the browser when it's fetching a script from a different website. It tells the browser whether it's okay to share some extra information, like cookies or authentication details, along with the request for that script.

- **anonymous**: This means the browser can fetch the script without sending any extra information.

- **use-credentials**: This means the browser should send some extra information, like cookies or authentication details, along with the request for the script.

If the `crossorigin` attribute is specified without a value, like this:

```html
<script crossorigin src="https://example.com/script.js"></script>

then it defaults to the anonymous value. So, it's essentially the same as
specifying crossorigin="anonymous". In this case, the browser fetches the script
without sending any extra information along with the request.
```
